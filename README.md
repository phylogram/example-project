It is a jupyter notebook, which is rendered here: <a href="https://github.com/phylogram/example-project/blob/master/Example_Project_final.ipynb">https://github.com/phylogram/example-project/blob/master/Example_Project_final.ipynb</a>, but unfortunately some of the heatmaps in pandas style module are not rendered correctly here. For this you must download the notebook yourself.
